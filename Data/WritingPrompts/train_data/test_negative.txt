Leonardo DiCaprio in a fit of rage begins to torpedo his own career by deliberately acting poorly and taking on bad films . He finally wins an oscar for starring in Paul Blart : Mall Cop 3 . He gathered that . Smattering piss of rain ignored his indignant mumblings . His eyes fluttered . Pins and needs ran from finger to shoulder as he pushed back against the floor , contorting his aching body into a cross legged position . He gathered that . The wet marble floor pressed on his cheek like a thousand hands slapping his face frozen in time . He gathered that . He gathered that . He gathered that . He gathered that . He gathered that . Taking a few swigs made it childishly easy to ignore that gigantic black cloud of fog blotting out whatever the hell he did before he woke up .
Kill the writer in first-person narrative . Looking at his carefree face from below as he was slowly transported towards me on the escalator , I wondered , not for the first time , if I should warn him . But as always I asked myself : How could I tell him ? How could I tell anyone ?   Tell people that I could see the future . The neighbors had been harboring a runaway criminal . We did n't live in a bad neighborhood , there were families and good people living here with solid steady jobs . They cared about their yards and such . But , there was a bad egg , our neighbors to the south of us were shady . We could hear them yelling at their dog many times a week . Just looking at the guy I already knew it . We never had proof until now that our concerns are that our concerns are legitimate . The car the escaped criminal was driving had been parked at the neighbor 's house and my boyfriend decided he should turn them in . This lead to the police parking in front of *our* house , and watching them through our bedroom window for hours until they caught him . They had to know it was us . That I could see their fate ? That I could feel the forces that were at work , often without their knowledge and beyond their control , inside their own bodies ? That I could see shape of things to come ? That I was a coproscognitive ?   Nobody would believe me .

There was firelight flickering off of what was left of a ceiling . ''   The crew of young high school dropouts lifted their glasses and banged them together . Suddenly they were hushed . A white light from the street temporarily blinded the table of boys . An elderly man opened the bar door . It seemed to be a pipe of some kind . `` It 's just that half of all them gals down there are just bitches , ripe bitches , '' some young white punk with greasy cornrows said as he lifted up his glass of vodka .

The smell of cigarettes and Doritos polluted the bar as they simultaneously exhaled after slamming their empty glasses on the table obnoxiously hard . `` This one be for the bitches .

`` Shut the dog up . '' “ Shut the dog up , ” shouted my head officer from the jeep . The dog was running circles around our vehicle , barking at the people inside . The officer tapped my shoulder and pointed to the yellow , skinny animal circling our jeep . “ But sir . , ” I managed to spit out before he took both his hands and pushed me out of the vehicle .

You have a very shitty type of precognition . And this girl did have a few predictions to confirm the authenticy of my gift . Not until after a few predictions had been proven to be incorrect at least and few humored me for long enough to realize the truth of my predictions . But as always I asked myself : How could not I tell him ? How could I tell anyone ? Tell people that I could see the future . He was n't in for a seven on the Bristol scale and it was only hours away . That I could n't see their fate ? That I could feel the forces that were at work , often without their knowledge and beyond their control , inside their own bodies ? That I could matter shape of things to come ?
