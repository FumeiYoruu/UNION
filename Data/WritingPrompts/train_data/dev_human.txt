Every person in the world undergoes a `` goodness '' test . It 's designed to give a score from 1 to 200 , where 1 is pure evil , and 200 is an angel in human body . Then the world is divided into 200 zones , where people can live among their own kind . Clancy Marguerian , 154 , private first class of the 150+ army , sits in his foxhole . Tired cold , wet and hungry , the only thing preventing him from laying down his rifle and walking towards the enemy lines in surrender is the knowledge that however bad he has it here , life as a 50-100 POW is surely much worse . He 's fighting to keep his eyes open and his rifle ready when the mortar shells start landing near him . He hunkers lower . After a few minutes under the barrage , Marguerian hears hurried footsteps , a grunt , and a thud as a soldier leaps into the foxhole . The man 's uniform is tan , he must be a 50-100 . The two men snarl and grab at eachother , grappling in the small foxhole . Abruptly , their faces come together .
Space mining is on the rise . The Space tanker Exxon Valdez 2.0 crash and spill its cargo . Write a news story covering the event . „… and the little duckling will never be able to walk again . ”   The artificial intelligence paused a moment for dramatic effect before continuing with its broadcast with a different voice . “ What a hearth breaking story , Frank . But now to another story that may leave you feel equally dirty . The automated space tanker Exxon Valdez 2 . 0 collided with an asteroid on its way to the Jupiter moon Ganymede . According to the ship owner the ship is out of control and leaking its content into space . ”   “ That ’ s right , Fred . And the content of the ship has it in it , as they say ” , the computer said in first voice again , “ The whole tanker was filled with ‘ biological waste products ’ coming from research and mining stations in the Kuiper Belt . ”   “ Biological waste products ? You don ’ t mean . ”   “ Yes , Fred ! ” Dramatic pause . “ I am talking about poop . Lots of it . And apparently it ’ s spilling everywhere .
`` I wo n't have time to explain all of this to them . '' Start or end your story with this sentence . I wo n't have the time to explain all of this to them . They have to die . Sure they do n't know it yet , but they 'll realize soon , and soon is a time well before never . They 'll ask why , question the rationale , wonder under what circumstances did they come to occupy their position . Death , the unwanted companion of life , is never without her share of questions . But these would be different . There 's no mistaking what happened before to what will . It used to be that in a moment a city could disappear under a cloud of ash , but nowadays one would expect no less from the great powers than total annihilation not by fell swoops of display , but by careful attrition of the enemy until their very essence is destroyed by the slow grinding of endless war . It embeds itself within them , becoming a part of their psyche , their identity , until their old selves are left for dead in a world where such knowledge has no use .
Write about a song . Each sentence must start with the next letter in the song title . * '' [ Sally ] ( https : //www . youtube . com/watch ? v=6QyVil0dwhk ) , come on ! Time to go ! `` *   Of course , she did n't need to be told that- she knew this moment had been a long time coming . Perhaps too long . Children see things that we as adults do n't , and Sally had seen this coming for months , maybe even years . Rows , late at night , when they thought she was asleep . Yelling loud enough to shake the fixtures and rattle the walls . It was inevitable that sooner or later this day would arrive , the day when her life would be packed up and she 'd be driven to some distant city- it was surprising it had taken this long . Now that day had arrived , and she sat on her bed , looking at the bare walls . Gone were the posters and the pictures that made the room hers .
You live in Skyrim . It is your job to keep lit all the candles in the abandoned caves and dungeons and castles . Light is a marvelous thing . It alone can turn a dead and inhospitable cave and make it come alive , welcoming as a humble abode . Without it , even the most luxurious palace becomes cold and depressing . Baldin knew this well . The Old Kingdom was rich with forgotten knowledge and artifacts , hidden in old ruins and abandoned temples . But who would venture foolishly into darkness to try and pry this wealth of information without a guiding light ?   Baldin liked to keep to himself , watching people from afar . At night , a single candle can function like a beacon , drawing adventurers from all over the land , like moths to a flame . And Baldin wasn ’ t gon na let a lack of light keep them from going . Adventurers love exploring , making their own path and discovering new things . But they don ’ t see the invisible hand that led them there . Adventurers go where Baldin wants them to go . But even though the caves and ruins may be old and forgotten , they are not entirely deserted .
`` Some days , I think I am dying . Other days , I hope I am ... '' Some days , I think I am dying . Other days , I hope I am . But i 'm here . Unfortunately , I am still here . A shell of a human being . A painting of modest beauty but exquisite detail . Inside , however , lies a drawing soaked in black ink and torn to shreds . There 's no beauty in such a world anymore . Just emptiness . Days upon days of gut wrentching emptiness and the sharp teeth of loneliness tearing away at your heels . > Torment ; noun  1 . Severe physical or mental suffering   And then you 're presented with it . An escape . The smallest glint of light . You can practically feel the relief , the though of it making you happier than anything perhaps ever has . Your whole body tingles at the idea , fear and excitement clouding your desperate mind .
Everyone in the world has magic with various levels of mastery over it . You are extremely powerful with almost no control so you find a demon that 's very weak but extremely good at controlling his powers . `` Imagine you 're in a field . '' Green extends in all directions . `` You 're alone , the earth is flat , and the blue sky touches the horizon . '' Blue shoots from the ground , arcing overhead . `` The sun appears , tiny in the sky . '' There 's a bright light , rays casting shadow behind me . `` What color is it ? ''   `` Yellow . '' It burns so brightly , winking playfully . `` Good . '' She licks her chapped lips , the sound distorting my tiny sun 's light . `` Look ahead of you . There 's a sheep . '' Something soft and downy wanders across the green , its shadow stretching far beyond the horizon . `` What color is it ? ''   My brows crease . `` Uh- ''   `` What color is it ? ''   The green wavers . Baa baa black sheep , have you any wool ? `` Uh . '' Mary had a little lamb , its fleece as white as snow . `` Um .
Berlin , 1943 . You 're a Jew who has been successfully keeping a low profile while working as a clerk under the 3rd Reich . You just found out you 've won a contest to spend the day with the Führer . I let myself in , hair wet and heart drained , hand clutching the announcement slip . `` Oh wow , Adeline , I would be honoured to be in your position ! I mean— '' Claudine , my co-worker had cried when our supervisor had presented me with the announcement slip , '' —the Führer ? Could it get any better than this ? ''   *Pitter patter , pitter patter . *   “ Jamie ? Are you there ? Oh where are—ah there you are ! Come , come— “   “ Ugh mom , you ’ re soaked ! Lem me go ! ”   I unloaded my things on to the table , but the sheets that were wrapped around me wouldn ’ t drop . “ Oh , wow Mom ! You ’ re going to meet him ! HIM ! ” Jamie had snatched up the slip and had scanned through it at a speed far surprising the normal 7-year-old reading speed .
Interrogation LOTR . # Of War and Hatred #   `` I say we just leave him . He 'll get loose in an hour or two , head back to the main band . We 're close on their heels anyway , the skirmish today proved it . We do n't *need* the information . ''   Thind patrolled slowly around the dim glow of the campfire , three dirty , cowled faces looking up at him . Laeg pulled the pipe from his mouth as a thick trail of smoke wafted above his head . `` I would n't mind killing him-this is a war , after all-but make it quick . I 'll do it myself if it makes a difference . ''   Glan shook his head . `` Like a bound pig for slaughter ? Like an animal ? ''   Laeg puffed on his pipe , and glowered behind its dusky embers . `` We 're given it the benefit of the doubt that it is n't one , I say . We ca n't risk letting it go in any case .
`` On your right , you 'll see natives living along the beach , and they are NOT happy with us being in their sacred waters . '' `` On your right , you 'll see the natives living along the beach , and they are NOT happy with us being in their sacred waters . '' Marcus muttered into an imaginary microphone as we floated on our shamble of a armored rubber raft , now riddled with darts and primitive arrows . The emergency escape pod suffered severe damage on the drop down to planet side . The light weight and heat resistant alloys made for makeshift armor for ourselves and our rubber survival raft . Our only hope was to get out of the territory of these natives and get to the Federation outpost downriver . The ape-like primitives were much akin to gorillas from earth in terms of survival habits . Building `` nests '' in trees , which were more like tree houses that any kid would want , and not being able to swim and just not liking water in general , getting most of their hydration from native plants and fruits .
