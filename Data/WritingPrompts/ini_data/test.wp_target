The wet marble floor pressed on his cheek like a thousand hands slapping his face frozen in time . Smattering piss of rain ignored his indignant mumblings . His eyes fluttered . Pins and needs ran from finger to shoulder as he pushed back against the floor , contorting his aching body into a cross legged position . Last night was bad . He gathered that . His routine dullness of though crept inwards from the edges of his mind toward the black mist that veiled his most recent memories . He struggled to recall whatever he could n't recall but only for a moment before he decided it probably was n't worth the effort .  He glanced around the room for a few minutes before concluding that he probably did n't know where he was . His investigation was n't entirely fruitless , he discovered a mostly full bottle of vodka . It was cheap but would definitely get the job done . Taking a few swigs made it childishly easy to ignore that gigantic black cloud of fog blotting out whatever the hell he did before he woke up .  There was a mirror in the
It 's been three days since my boyfriend pissed off the neighbors .   They had to be pissed , he called the police on them . The neighbors had been harboring a runaway criminal . We did n't live in a bad neighborhood , there were families and good people living here with solid steady jobs . They cared about their yards and such . But , there was a bad egg , our neighbors to the south of us were shady . We could hear them yelling at their dog many times a week . Strange smoke often came out of their house , and the lights in the garage were on at odd hours . We never had proof until now that our concerns are legitimate .   The car the escaped criminal was driving had been parked at the neighbor 's house and my boyfriend decided he should turn them in . This lead to the police parking in front of *our* house , and watching them through our bedroom window for hours until they caught him . They had to know it was us . And it freaked me out .
George fled . Not terrifically fast , not at his age nor in his shape . The voice echoed throughout the house after him .   `` I 'm coming , you fat fuck ! You 've done me in and you 'll pay for it ! ''   George wheezed into his office , closed the door and got to work tipping the file cabinet next to it . Over it went , blocking the door . He knelt at the safe set under his desk , opposite the door .   There was a pounding at the door , a shoulder slamming into it . The cabinet held in place , thanks in some part to the thick carpet . The door pounded again as Bean slammed into it again , this time the wood cracking a little bit .   `` I 'LL GET IN THERE YOU FAT FUCK ! '' Bean shouted .   George twisted the lock furiously , muttering under his breath . `` Oh six ... Oh six ... Ninety six ... DAMNIT ! '' The lock failed to open . He tried again , a second time
It was dark and Levi was pretty sure he was lying on his back . There was firelight flickering off of what was left of a ceiling . He could hear something but it was muffled . He was almost positive it was screaming . When he tried to move he felt an excruciating pain in his left side that caused him to cry out . His hand moved to it instinctively and found something protruding from the wound . It seemed to be a pipe of some kind . He attempted to pull it out but it was covered in blood making it slick .   Levi 's ears began ringing and the sounds began to become clearer , it felt quite a bit like some one was driving needles into his eardrums . The sounds he was hearing were definitely screams and not just one person 's , a lot of people were screaming or yelling . There was some one close to him that was crying . He looked in the direction of the tears and seen his sister kneeling beside him , her hands covering her face .   `` What happened Laur ?
`` Hi dad ! ''   The words snap me from my thoughts . I focus on the screen to see my son staring at me . He had a gap where a tooth had fallen out .   I forcefully pull a fake smile back . `` Hey bud , how 's it going ! Is mom home ? ''   `` Isaac , finish your homework first ! ''   My wife 's voice makes my smile less forced . `` Alright Isaac , go do your homework . I promise we 'll talk more soon , alright ? ''   `` Okay , dad . '' He replies , but the tone tells me he 's upset . His visage disappears and replaced by my wife 's .   `` I swear , the smallest thing distracts that boy . '' Her hair is in a hasty bun , and judging by the glisten of sweat and the smudge on her cheek she had been in the garden . Her blue eyes show more relief than anything else . `` Hi honey , so nice to hear from you ! It
“ Shut the dog up , ” shouted my head officer from the jeep . The dog was running circles around our vehicle , barking at the people inside . The officer tapped my shoulder and pointed to the yellow , skinny animal circling our jeep .   “ But sir.. , ” I managed to spit out before he took both his hands and pushed me out of the vehicle . I went tumbling out , and landed on the rough sandy ground . I stood up adjusting the gun hanging from my shoulder and proceeded to walk towards the canine . The dog stopped its barking , and shifted its black eyes to me .   “ Come here little pup . Hey come here , I ’ m not going to hurt ya , ” I said trying to coax it nearer to me . Actually , I didn ’ t know if I was going to hurt the little mutt or not yet . Reaching my hand towards my waist , I pulled off a tiny bit of my rations . I held it out my hand , with the ration laying on my
`` It 's just that half of all them gals down there are just bitches , ripe bitches , '' some young white punk with greasy cornrows said as he lifted up his glass of vodka . `` This one be for the bitches . ''   The crew of young high school dropouts lifted their glasses and banged them together . The smell of cigarettes and Doritos polluted the bar as they simultaneously exhaled after slamming their empty glasses on the table obnoxiously hard . For the next hour and half they energetically went through a myriad of conversation topics -- porn , ex-girlfriends , heroine , cars , dead friends , and alcohol . Their banter slowly descended into a madness of laughter , shot after shot . Suddenly they were hushed .   An elderly man opened the bar door . A white light from the street temporarily blinded the table of boys . The man pathetically shuffled over to the counter . He wore a worn-out plaid jacket and a pair of corduroy pants . Lightly tapping the table with his fingers , a husky bartender leaned over .   `` Need help
Dickbutt ... That was the first thing reddit was to do with their recent purchase of the moon .   `` We 're going to etch dickbutt with freakin ' lasers across the surface of the moon ! '' cried one post with over 100,000 upvotes .   There was n't much else they could do with the moon . I mean , reddit just spent all our money buying the floating rock . The government required an astronomical amount of funds for the purchase and the rest went to legal fees from all the other countries suing reddit for purchasing something that belongs to humanity .   `` We are humanity ! '' exclaimed a majority of reddit users , which eventually won us the case .   Dickbutt was only the beginning though . Thanks to an anonymous donor that built and sent a huge laser to reddit as a secret santa gift . They used it to mark reddit 's newly found territory . More memes were to come and in great detail . Soon after , the surface of the moon was a hub of graffiti of all and every meme that
Just looking at the guy I already knew it . He was in for a seven on the Bristol scale and it was only hours away .   Looking at his carefree face from below as he was slowly transported towards me on the escalator , I wondered , not for the first time , if I should warn him . But as always I asked myself : How could I tell him ? How could I tell anyone ?   Tell people that I could see the future . That I could see their fate ? That I could feel the forces that were at work , often without their knowledge and beyond their control , inside their own bodies ? That I could see shape of things to come ? That I was a coproscognitive ?   Nobody would believe me . Not until after a few predictions had been proven to be correct at least and few humored me for long enough to realize the truth of my predictions .   And this guy did n't have a few predictions to confirm the authenticy of my gift . He needed to know and
Tell us your faults ? Really ? This was the question - the shibboleth - that unlocked the cosmos ?   The Masters could have picked a scientist to answer but they feared she might mask ignorance . They could have picked from our global leaders bit they feared that they would mask deceit . They could have picked a holy man but feared he would mask violence , oppression , hate , intolerance ... the list of disqualifying sins was almost too long to enumerate .   So they picked Josh Thornton , a 45 year old MBA in human resources .   `` Our greatest weakness ? Well , I think we work a little too hard and , as a race , we might be a bit of a perfectionist .
